# Investigation profiles and records

Use `investigation` to decide what to inspect next and record reproducible checks.
Triage reads up to 12 header bytes and cites stable rules, evidence/offsets and
suggested available operations. PNG suggests chunks, JPEG/TIFF suggests EXIF,
WAVE suggests stream metadata and unknown bytes suggest hex/strings. Suggestions
are not automatically executed and never establish concealed content.

Profiles have two depths: metadata performs triage; preview adds a 256-byte hex
view and strings from the first 4096 bytes (minimum length 4, at most 32 results).
Optional identity hashes the complete input; only an admitted prefix is otherwise
buffered. For a reusable profile, save this as `preview.json`:

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "depth": "preview",
  "identify": true,
  "budgets": {"max_operations": 4, "max_elapsed_ms": 5000}
}
```

Only `format_version` is required. The default depth is metadata; identity is off.
Default budgets allow 1 MiB source buffering, 4 MiB charged inspected ranges,
16 operation units, 64 KiB retained results and 5000 ms cooperative time.
Hard operation/time ceilings are 64 units and 60000 ms; other limits can only be
lowered from those defaults. Budget fields are `max_input_bytes`,
`max_inspected_bytes`, `max_operations`, `max_retained_bytes`, `max_elapsed_ms`.
Repeated source ranges are charged again; a pipeline wrapper and each step consume
operation units, while pipeline value/work limits still apply. `plan` exposes the
allowlist, ranges, budgets, capture bounds and skipped reasons without content reads.

Optional `pipeline` contains `steps` and lowered `limits` from the composition
contract. `retain_results:[2]` selects in-memory results by session-local run ID;
`record_parameters:true` opts into pipeline parameter retention. Captures use
conservative bounds, so a small actual result can still be skipped. Deadlines and
cancellation are checked around reads/operations, without preemption; elapsed time
is diagnostic and excluded from deterministic records. Read partial/skipped/failed
outcomes rather than treating budget exhaustion as a complete investigation.

Session records use `schema_version:1`, `status`, `replay_gaps`, `uncertainty` and
`session`. The session has format/engine versions, input identity, limits, runs,
findings, separately labeled hypotheses and optional profile context/counters.
Findings trace to an input/run/offset. Raw input contents, paths and timestamps are
not saved. Default export also omits selected result contents, nonempty parameters
and hypotheses; retention and export are independent explicit choices.

Records cap at 128 KiB, retained result JSON at 64 KiB, runs at 64, findings at 128,
and hypotheses at 32 (1024 UTF-8 bytes each). Direct session/replay input is at most
1 MiB. Loading validates IDs, references, states and retained-result digests.
Human reports escape untrusted strings. Saving requires a caller-selected new
file; remove it with normal filesystem tools. No hidden session database or copies
are created. Omitted/redacted data cannot be recovered from a saved record.

Replay validates all contracts and required parameters, checks caller-supplied
size/SHA-256 identity, then compares reproduced typed result digests/states. Size
alone cannot establish identity; missing digests, redactions, incompatible versions
or changed inputs are explicit failures. Skipped runs stay skipped. Hypotheses are
not replayed as machine evidence. Digests identify content, not trust, and reports
are not signed attestations. See [record and replay an investigation](../../guides/investigations.md)
for a walkthrough. Python exposes these workflows through `InvestigationSession`;
see the [SDK guide](../../interfaces/python.md#discover-operations).
